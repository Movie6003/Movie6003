ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alberto V, AKA @Movie6003

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a professional with nearly 20 years of experience in issues related to fraud, both front-end (fraud prevention) and back-office (fraud case management).
    Iâ€™ve played different roles for financial entities in which Iâ€™ve always collaborated with a marked analyst approach. 
    I consider myself with good communication skills, accustomed to team management and detail-oriented in the execution of assigned tasks. 
    Now, Iâ€™m interested in cibersecurity.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cibersecurity essentials and Data Anlasys and also javascript programming.
